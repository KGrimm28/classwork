		<h2><font size ="6">Early Life</font></h2>
			<p>On December 30, 1984, LeBron Raymone James was born to Gloria Marie James, who was only 16-years-old, in Akron, Ohio. James was introduced to basketball when he was nine years old. His mother wanted him to live in a family environment, so he lived with Frank Walker (a youth football coach).<br />
				<br /> James began playing for the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars. He and three others on the team were known as the "Fab Four."<br />
				<br />James later attended St. Vincent-St. Mary High School. He averaged 21 points and 6 rebounds as a freshmen. As a sophomore, he averaged 25.2 points and 7.2 rebounds. James was so good that St. Vincent-St. Mary played at University of Akron's Rhodes Arena for alumni, fans, and college and NBA scouts to watch him play. James was named <i>Ohio Mr. Basketball</i>. James was also featured on <i>Sports Illustrated</i> covers. James wanted to join in at the 2002 NBA Draft. James also was a wide receiver in high school. He could've been in the NFL, but he was not.</p>
